building an app that tracks todo items

this app will have 5 routes that do the following

Add an item

POST /items
{
    "label": "feed the cat",
    "notes": "the cat likes tuna, but is only allowed 1 can a week.",
    


}



--------

Internally to the app we want to store items, and we want to track the following about them

id: uniquely identifies item
label: this is general summary of the item
notes: notes about this item
done: true if this item is done, false if not done
